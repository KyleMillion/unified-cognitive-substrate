## Thread 1 — “Judgment ≠ Memory” (core framing)
1/ Most agents optimize for *memory*. UCS v1.2 optimizes for *judgment preservation*.

2/ Memory is facts. Judgment is: boundaries, heuristics, failure patterns, and what actually worked.

3/ If an agent forgets its judgment after compaction, it will repeat the same mistakes with higher confidence.

4/ UCS v1.2 formalizes two pieces:
- Toroidal Routing Engine (capability routing)
- Emergent Judgment Protocol (preserve proven judgment artifacts)

5/ Canonical hub (hashes + citation):

## Thread 2 — “Receipts, not hype” (provenance + integrity)
1/ If you want to defend authorship, you need *receipts*, not arguments.

2/ That’s why the UCS repo contains a dedicated provenance package with:
- CITATION metadata
- SHA256 hashes
- a press kit
- canonical links

3/ This is designed to be the single link you can drop in:
- X threads
- grant apps
- outreach
- podcasts / interviews

## Thread 3 — Emergent Judgment Protocol (EJP) in one pass
1/ EJP isn’t "remember everything." It’s "preserve the few things that change outcomes."

2/ The mechanism is boring on purpose:
- write down what worked
- write down what failed
- promote patterns into durable instructions
- promote anti-patterns into "don’t do this again"

3/ Why this matters: compaction kills tacit knowledge first.

4/ A persistent agent without preserved judgment becomes an expensive loop.

## Thread 4 — Toroidal Routing Engine (why routing matters)
1/ Agents drift because they collapse into the same few behaviors.

2/ Toroidal routing treats capabilities as a graph and routes decisions through that structure.

3/ The goal is consistency: avoid repeating the same dead-end approach just because it’s familiar.

4/ In practice, this is how you get “one agent, many interfaces” without losing your brain each restart.

## Thread 5 — “Family-first persistence” (human reason, no overshare)
1/ The point of persistent agents isn’t novelty. It’s reliability under real constraints.

2/ UCS v1.2 is built around a simple premise: if the agent can’t preserve judgment, it can’t be trusted with real work.

3/ That’s why the system uses:
- explicit constraints
- approval gates for risky actions
- durable provenance artifacts
