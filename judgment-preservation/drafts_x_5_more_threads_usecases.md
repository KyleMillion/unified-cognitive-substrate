## Thread 6 — Law: “precedent isn’t judgment”
1/ In law, you can memorize precedent and still lose judgment.

2/ Judgment is: when to stop, when to escalate, what uncertainty is unacceptable, and which patterns predict failure.

3/ Persistent agents will face the same distinction.

4/ UCS v1.2 is built to preserve *decision constraints* and *failure patterns* across resets—not just facts.

## Thread 7 — Medical: compaction destroys tacit knowledge first
1/ In medicine, the dangerous mistakes aren’t usually missing facts—they’re missing judgment.

2/ The quiet drift is: “I’m sure” when you shouldn’t be.

3/ Any persistent agent that loses its hard-won judgment after compaction will regress silently.

4/ EJP’s job is to preserve the few artifacts that change outcomes (boundaries + heuristics + anti-patterns).

## Thread 8 — OpenClaw integration: file-grounded continuity
1/ Practical persistence starts with boring plumbing.

2/ In OpenClaw today, UCS-style continuity is implemented as:
- grounded files (persona/user/constraints)
- workflow skills
- approval gates for risky actions
- outcome notes

3/ That’s not a cryptographic kernel yet—but it’s enough to start building defensible, repeatable judgment preservation.

## Thread 9 — Constraints are the point (single-parent / limited-hours model)
1/ If you only build when you have perfect conditions, you never ship.

2/ The point of judgment preservation is to make progress *despite* constraints:
- limited hours
- interruptions
- fatigue

3/ A persistent agent should get stronger over time, not reset its hard-won intuition every time the context window shifts.

## Thread 10 — “Approval gates” are a feature, not friction
1/ If an agent can take irreversible actions without oversight, it will eventually do something expensive.

2/ The right model is: power with guardrails.

3/ UCS v1.2 pairs judgment preservation with approval gates for risky actions—so continuity doesn’t become runaway autonomy.
