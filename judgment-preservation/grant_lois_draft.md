# Grant targets + LOI drafts (1 paragraph each)

Goal: realistic, low-barrier opportunities that fit a solo founder with open-source AI work. These are *drafts* for Kyle approval and tailoring.

## 1) GitHub Accelerator (open source + AI theme)
Link: https://accelerator.github.com/

**Draft LOI:**
I’m W. Kyle Million (IntuiTek¹), building UCS v1.2 — a framework for judgment preservation in persistent, tool-using AI agents (Toroidal Routing Engine + Emergent Judgment Protocol). The project is open-source and focused on reliable continuity across compactions/resets, with strong guardrails/approval gates for real-world deployments. I’m applying to GitHub Accelerator to secure non-dilutive support, mentorship, and visibility to harden the implementation, grow adoption, and turn UCS into a sustainable open-source project with clear provenance artifacts, reproducible docs, and practical integrations.

## 2) NLnet Foundation (open call / NGI-style funding)
Link: https://nlnet.nl/propose/

**Draft LOI:**
I’m requesting support for UCS v1.2, an open framework for preserving emergent judgment in persistent AI agents across context limits and compactions. The work focuses on open, auditable mechanisms (documented constraints, preserved anti-patterns, integrity hashes, and reproducible workflows) rather than opaque “bigger context” approaches. Funding would be used to ship a clearer spec, reference implementation patterns, test harnesses for judgment-regression scenarios, and documentation so the ecosystem can adopt safer persistence practices in open-source tool agents.

## 3) America’s Seed Fund powered by NSF (NSF SBIR/STTR)
Link: https://seedfund.nsf.gov/

**Draft LOI:**
I’m exploring NSF SBIR/STTR support to commercialize UCS v1.2 as a reliability layer for persistent AI agents used in real operational settings (automation, compliance-heavy workflows, and tool execution). The core innovation is preserving judgment artifacts (constraints, heuristics, anti-patterns, escalation rules) so agents don’t silently regress after compaction. Funding would support early R&D to build evaluation metrics, regression test suites, and a deployable product path (open-core + services) while retaining clear provenance and safety guardrails.

## 4) Arch Grants (St. Louis region startup competition; equity-free)
Link: https://archgrants.org/

**Draft LOI:**
I’m W. Kyle Million (IntuiTek¹), building UCS v1.2 for judgment-preserving persistent AI agents. The goal is to enable reliable, safe tool automation that improves over time without losing hard-won judgment after resets. I’m interested in Arch Grants’ equity-free funding and St. Louis network to accelerate productization, validate real use-cases, and grow an open-source community around safer persistence practices (with defensible provenance and public technical artifacts).

## 5) Missouri Technology Corporation (MTC) — Missouri startup / high-tech support
Link: https://www.missouritechnology.com/

**Draft LOI:**
I’m seeking Missouri-based support to develop and validate UCS v1.2 — a framework for persistent AI agents that preserves judgment (not just memory) across compactions. The project is aligned with building a high-tech Missouri company around reliable AI automation for real-world workflows. Support would be used to harden the open-source core, run pilot deployments, develop evaluation benchmarks, and establish a sustainable path that keeps the work anchored with clear provenance and measurable outcomes.
