# X Drafts (10) — UCS v1.2 / Judgment Preservation

Canonical link (provenance hub): https://github.com/KyleMillion/unified-cognitive-substrate#judgment-preservation

---

## 1) One-liner + link
UCS v1.2 is my framework for **judgment preservation** in persistent AI agents (not "more memory" — preserved decisions + constraints + proven patterns).

Canonical repo + hashes: https://github.com/KyleMillion/unified-cognitive-substrate#judgment-preservation

---

## 2) What problem it solves
Most “persistent agents” lose the *best part* after compaction: the hard-won judgment.

UCS v1.2 = Toroidal Routing Engine + Emergent Judgment Protocol to preserve that.

## 3) Thread: Judgment ≠ memory (short thread)
Thread:

1/ Memory is cheap. Judgment is expensive.
2/ A persistent agent that forgets its judgment after compaction will repeat the same failures.
3/ UCS v1.2 is built to preserve *judgment artifacts* (boundaries, heuristics, failure patterns) across resets.

## 4) Concrete claim + evidence link
Concrete claim: the safest “anti-drift” mechanism isn’t bigger context — it’s **externalized constraints + auditable workflows**.

## 5) Provenance note (no drama, just receipts)
I’m publishing UCS v1.2 as a canonical provenance hub so there’s a clean, timestamped reference for attribution.

Repo + citation: https://github.com/KyleMillion/unified-cognitive-substrate#judgment-preservation

## 6) Short thread: Emergent Judgment Protocol
Thread:

1/ Emergent Judgment Protocol (EJP) = write down what actually worked.
2/ Promote proven patterns into durable instructions.
3/ Promote proven failures into “never do this again.”
4/ The goal: continuity without hallucinated confidence.

## 7) Toroidal Routing Engine (simple)
Toroidal Routing Engine: route tasks through a stable capability graph so the agent doesn’t mode-collapse into the same few behaviors.

## 8) Practical angle (builders)
If you’re building tool-using agents: treat “judgment” as an asset that must survive restarts.

I’m documenting UCS v1.2 publicly (repo includes citation + hashes): https://github.com/KyleMillion/unified-cognitive-substrate#judgment-preservation
