UCS v1.2 (Toroidal Routing Engine + Emergent Judgment Protocol) is a practical framework for persistent AI agents operating in real tool environments. It focuses on preventing silent regression by externalizing critical judgment, constraints, and proven patterns into durable artifacts, then routing future decisions through that preserved substrate. The goal is not maximal memory, but reliable continuity—so an agent can keep improving without losing the hard-won intuition that makes it useful.
