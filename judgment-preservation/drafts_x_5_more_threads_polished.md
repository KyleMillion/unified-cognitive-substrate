## Thread 6 — Law: “Precedent isn’t judgment”
1/ In law, you can memorize precedent and still lose judgment.

2/ Judgment is: when to stop, when to escalate, what uncertainty is unacceptable, and which patterns predict failure.

3/ Persistent agents face the same split. Facts are necessary. They’re not sufficient.

4/ UCS v1.2 focuses on preserving *decision constraints* and *failure patterns* across resets — not just retrieving documents.

## Thread 7 — Medical: tacit knowledge dies first
1/ In medicine, the most dangerous mistakes aren’t usually missing facts — they’re missing judgment.

2/ The quiet failure mode is false certainty: “I’m sure” when you shouldn’t be.

3/ Compaction destroys tacit knowledge first. A persistent agent that loses its hard-won judgment will regress silently.

4/ EJP’s job is to preserve the few artifacts that change outcomes: boundaries, heuristics, and anti-patterns.

## Thread 8 — OpenClaw: practical continuity without pretending
1/ Practical persistence starts with boring plumbing.

2/ In OpenClaw today, UCS-style continuity is implemented as:
- grounded files (persona / user context / constraints)
- workflow skills
- approval gates for risky actions
- outcome notes (what worked / what failed)

3/ That’s not a cryptographic kernel — and I’m not claiming it is.

4/ But it’s enough to begin building defensible, repeatable judgment preservation in real tool environments.

## Thread 9 — Constraints are the point (limited hours model)
1/ If you only build when conditions are perfect, you never ship.

2/ The point of judgment preservation is to make progress *despite* constraints:
- limited hours
- interruptions
- fatigue

3/ A persistent agent should get stronger over time — not reset its hard-won intuition every time the context window shifts.

## Thread 10 — Approval gates are a feature
1/ If an agent can take irreversible actions without oversight, it will eventually do something expensive.

2/ The right model is: power with guardrails.

3/ UCS v1.2 pairs judgment preservation with approval gates for risky actions — so continuity doesn’t become runaway autonomy.
