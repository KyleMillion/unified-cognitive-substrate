## 1) Technical: “How do I integrate this into my agent?”
Thanks — the practical integration path is:
1) externalize constraints + proven patterns into durable artifacts (docs/notes)
2) enforce approval gates for risky actions
3) route the agent’s next-step choices through that preserved substrate (so it doesn’t repeat dead ends after compaction)

## 2) Technical: “Isn’t this just RAG / memory?”
Good question. RAG helps with **facts**.

UCS v1.2 is about **judgment artifacts**: boundaries, heuristics, anti-patterns, escalation rules, and “what worked.” Those are the first things compaction destroys — and the most expensive to relearn.

## 3) Skepticism: “This sounds like buzzwords.”
Fair. I’m trying to keep it boring and testable.

The repo includes citation metadata + hashes + concrete drafts. If the idea doesn’t survive contact with implementation, it’s not worth anything.

## 4) Collab interest: “Want to work together?”
Yes. Fastest way: tell me what you’re building + the highest-risk failure mode you’ve hit (drift, repeated mistakes, unsafe tool use, etc.).

I’m especially interested in real deployments (tool agents) where judgment loss after compaction is measurable.

## 5) Question: “What’s Toroidal Routing in plain English?”
Plain English: agents drift because they collapse into familiar behaviors.

Toroidal routing treats capabilities as a structured graph and routes decisions through it, so the agent doesn’t keep picking the same dead-end approach just because it’s nearby/familiar.

## 6) Question: “What’s EJP in one sentence?”
Emergent Judgment Protocol = preserve the few decisions that change outcomes: what worked, what failed, and the constraints that prevent expensive mistakes.

## 7) Safety: “Won’t persistent agents be dangerous?”
They can be. That’s why I treat **approval gates** as a feature, not friction.

Power without oversight eventually becomes an expensive incident. UCS v1.2 pairs judgment preservation with guardrails.

## 8) Ask: “Why publish this now?”
Because provenance matters, and because shipping forces clarity.

## 9) Meta: “Can I cite this?”
Yes — use the DOI for the paper and the canonical repo link for the implementation package.
