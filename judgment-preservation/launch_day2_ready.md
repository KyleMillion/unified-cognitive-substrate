# Day 2 Follow-up Thread (ready)

Chosen from the polished threads as the best **Day 2 follow-up** because it is:
- highly actionable (“how to integrate / what it looks like in practice”)
- ties directly back to Launch Thread framing (judgment preservation requires boring plumbing)
- invites builders without sounding abstract

## X thread (copy/paste)

1/ Practical persistence starts with boring plumbing.

2/ In OpenClaw today, UCS-style continuity is implemented as:
- grounded files (persona / user context / constraints)
- workflow skills
- approval gates for risky actions
- outcome notes (what worked / what failed)

3/ That’s not a cryptographic kernel — and I’m not claiming it is.

4/ But it’s enough to begin building **defensible, repeatable judgment preservation** in real tool environments.

6/ Paper (Zenodo DOI):

7/ Personal note: I'm building this in the margins—between dad duties and real life—so my bar is simple: reliability that survives interruptions.
