1/ **Judgment ≠ memory.**

Most “persistent agents” optimize for recall. UCS v1.2 optimizes for **judgment preservation**: the boundaries, heuristics, and failure-pattern awareness you *only* earn by shipping.

2/ Memory is facts. Judgment is what keeps you from repeating the same mistake with higher confidence after every reset/compaction.

3/ That’s the core failure mode I care about:
A tool-using agent that “remembers” but loses judgment will loop—quietly—until it burns time, money, or trust.

4/ UCS v1.2 has two parts:
- **Toroidal Routing Engine** (capability routing so you don’t mode-collapse into the same habits)
- **Emergent Judgment Protocol (EJP)** (preserve proven patterns + preserve proven failures)

5/ EJP is intentionally boring:
- write down what worked
- write down what failed
- promote the patterns into durable instructions
- promote the failures into “don’t do this again”

Because compaction kills tacit knowledge first.

6/ I’m publishing this with **receipts, not hype**:
- citation metadata
- SHA256 hashes
- press-kit assets
- canonical links

So attribution is easy and defensible.

7/ Tasteful reality check: I’m building this under real constraints (single dad energy, limited hours). That’s why I care about *reliability* over novelty.

9/ Paper (Zenodo DOI):

10/ If this is aligned with what you’re building:
- ⭐ star the repo
- fork if you want to extend it
- DM me if you want to collaborate (research, implementation, or real-world agent deployments)
